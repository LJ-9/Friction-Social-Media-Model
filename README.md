# Information-Pollution-by-Social-Bots-Simple

This repository contains code to reproduce the results in the paper [*Information Pollution by Social Bots*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06130).

## Environment

Our code is based on **Python3.6+**, with **jupyter notebook**.

## Notes

Our results in the paper are based on averages across at least **10 simulation runs**. If you want to reproduce thoses resulut, we suggest running the simulations on a cluster environment, since they will need a lot of memory and CPU time.
