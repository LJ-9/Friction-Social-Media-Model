# Manipulating the Online Marketplace of Ideas

This repository contains code to reproduce the results in the paper [*Manipulating the Online Marketplace of Ideas*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06130) by Xiaodan Lou, Alessandro Flammini, and [Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/).

## Environment

Our code is based on **Python3.6+**, with **jupyter notebook**.

## Notes

The results in the paper are based on averages across multiple simulation runs. To reproduce those results, we suggest running the simulations in parallel, for example on a cluster, since they will need a lot of memory and CPU time.
